## ðŸ“˜ **Unit 2: Process Scheduling and Synchronization**

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Part A: Process Scheduling**

---

### ðŸ”¸ 1. **Process**

A **process** is a program in execution. It includes:

- Program counter
    
- Stack
    
- Data section
    
- Registers
    

---

### ðŸ”¸ 2. **Process States**

1. **New** â€“ process is being created.
    
2. **Ready** â€“ waiting to be assigned to CPU.
    
3. **Running** â€“ instructions are being executed.
    
4. **Waiting** â€“ waiting for some event.
    
5. **Terminated** â€“ process has finished execution.
    

---

### ðŸ”¸ 3. **Scheduler Types**

| Scheduler Type                           | Role                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Long-term Scheduler**                  | Selects which processes are admitted to system for processing. |
| **Short-term Scheduler (CPU Scheduler)** | Selects among ready processes for execution.                   |
| **Medium-term Scheduler**                | Temporarily removes processes from memory (swapping).          |

---

### ðŸ”¸ 4. **CPU Scheduling**

Occurs when CPU switches from one process to another.

#### **Scheduling Criteria:**

- CPU Utilization
    
- Throughput
    
- Turnaround Time
    
- Waiting Time
    
- Response Time
    
- Fairness

### ðŸ”¸ 5. **CPU Scheduling Algorithms**

---

#### âœ… **1. First-Come First-Serve (FCFS)**

- Simple and non-preemptive.
    
- Process executed in order of arrival.
    

ðŸ“Œ **Drawback**: Convoy effect â€“ long processes delay shorter ones.

---

#### âœ… **2. Shortest Job First (SJF)**

- Selects process with shortest burst time.
    
- Optimal for minimizing average waiting time.
    

ðŸ“Œ **Types**:

- **Non-preemptive**
    
- **Preemptive (SRTF - Shortest Remaining Time First)**
    

---

#### âœ… **3. Priority Scheduling**

- Process with highest priority is scheduled first.
    
- Can be **preemptive** or **non-preemptive**.
    

ðŸ“Œ **Issue**: Starvation â€” low priority processes may never execute.

ðŸ›  **Solution**: Aging (increase priority over time).

---

#### âœ… **4. Round Robin (RR)**

- Each process gets a fixed **time quantum**.
    
- Preemptive.
    

âœ… Good for time-sharing systems.

ðŸ“Œ **Key Factor**: Choosing an optimal time quantum.

---

#### âœ… **5. Multilevel Queue Scheduling**

- Ready queue is split into multiple levels (foreground, background).
    
- Each queue has its own scheduling algorithm.
    
- Processes donâ€™t move between queues.
    

---

#### âœ… **6. Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling**

- Like multilevel queue but **processes can move between queues** based on behavior and age.
    

---

#### âœ… **7. Real-Time Scheduling**

- For systems with strict timing constraints.
    

ðŸ“Œ **Types**:

- **Hard Real-Time**: Must meet deadlines.
    
- **Soft Real-Time**: Preferable to meet deadlines.
    

ðŸ§  Algorithms: Rate Monotonic, Earliest Deadline First (EDF)

---

### ðŸ”¸ 6. **Context Switching**

- Switching CPU from one process to another.
    
- OS saves the state of old process and loads the state of new process.
    
- Introduces overhead (no useful work is done).
    

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Part B: Process Synchronization**

---

### ðŸ”¸ 1. **Why Synchronization?**

In a multiprogramming system, multiple processes access shared resources. **Process Synchronization** is needed to avoid inconsistencies and **race conditions**.

---

### ðŸ”¸ 2. **Critical Section Problem**

A **critical section** is a code segment where a shared resource is accessed.

#### **Conditions to Solve It (3 Rules):**

1. **Mutual Exclusion** â€“ Only one process in critical section.
    
2. **Progress** â€“ If no process is in CS, one of the waiting ones should enter.
    
3. **Bounded Waiting** â€“ Limit the number of times others can enter CS before one can re-enter.
    

---

### ðŸ”¸ 3. **Software Solutions**

#### âœ… **Petersonâ€™s Algorithm** (for two processes):

Uses two variables:

- `flag[2]` â€“ intent to enter CS
    
- `turn` â€“ whose turn it is
    

âœ… Ensures mutual exclusion and bounded waiting.

---

#### âœ… **Bakery Algorithm**

- Suitable for **n processes**
    
- Processes take a "number" and enter CS based on lowest number.
    

---

### ðŸ”¸ 4. **Hardware Solutions**

#### âœ… **Interrupt Disabling**

- Disable interrupts while in critical section.

ðŸ“Œ Not suitable for multiprocessor systems.

#### âœ… **Test and Set Instruction**

Atomic instruction used to implement locking.

---

### ðŸ”¸ 5. **Semaphores**

A **synchronization tool** to manage access to shared resources.

#### **Types**:

- **Binary Semaphore**: 0 or 1 (mutex-like)
    
- **Counting Semaphore**: Integer value â‰¥ 0
    

#### **Operations**:

- `wait(S)` or `P(S)` â†’ decrease semaphore, block if < 0
    
- `signal(S)` or `V(S)` â†’ increase semaphore, wake waiting process
    

---

### ðŸ”¸ 6. **Classical Synchronization Problems**

#### âœ… **1. Bounded Buffer (Producer-Consumer)**

- Producer adds, consumer removes.
    
- Use **mutex + full + empty semaphores**.
    

#### âœ… **2. Readers-Writers Problem**

- Multiple readers, one writer.
    
- Goal: Readers can access simultaneously, writers get exclusive access.
    

#### âœ… **3. Dining Philosophers**

- N philosophers sharing forks.
    
- Risk of deadlock and starvation.
    

---

### ðŸ”¸ 7. **Monitors**

High-level synchronization construct that ensures only one process is active in monitor at a time.

âœ… Language-supported solution (Java/C++ uses similar idea).
