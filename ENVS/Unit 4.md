## 🦋 **Unit 4: Biodiversity and its Conservation**

### 🔹 4.1 **Introduction**

- **Biodiversity** = “Biological Diversity” = Variety of life on Earth.
    
- Includes **plants**, **animals**, **microorganisms**, **ecosystems**, and **genetic variation**.
    

---

### 🔹 4.2 **Levels of Biodiversity**

1. **Genetic Diversity**:
    
    - Variety of genes within species (e.g., different rice varieties).
        
2. **Species Diversity**:
    
    - Variety of species within a habitat (e.g., lions, tigers, elephants).
        
3. **Ecosystem Diversity**:
    
    - Variety of ecosystems (e.g., forests, deserts, wetlands, coral reefs).

### 🔹 4.3 **Biogeographical Classification of India**

India has **10 biogeographic zones**:

1. Trans-Himalayan
    
2. Himalayan
    
3. Desert
    
4. Semi-arid
    
5. Western Ghats
    
6. Deccan Plateau
    
7. Gangetic Plain
    
8. North-east India
    
9. Coastal
    
10. Islands
    

➡️ Each zone has unique flora and fauna adapted to specific conditions.

### 🔹 4.4 **India as a Mega Diversity Nation**

- One of the **12 mega biodiversity countries** of the world.
    
- Accounts for:
    
    - **7.6%** of mammal species,
        
    - **12.6%** of bird species,
        
    - **6.2%** of reptiles,
        
    - **6%** of flowering plants.
        

➡️ **Hotspots** in India:

1. **Western Ghats**
    
2. **Indo-Burma region**
    
3. **Himalayas**
    
4. **Sundaland (Nicobar Islands)**

### 🔹 4.5 **Value of Biodiversity**

#### ✅ **1. Consumptive Use Value**

- Direct use: Food, fuel, medicine, timber (e.g., neem, tulsi, turmeric).
    

#### ✅ **2. Productive Use Value**

- Commercial products: Silk, wool, honey, resins, oils.
    

#### ✅ **3. Social Value**

- Cultural, religious (e.g., peepal tree, cow, tulsi worship).
    

#### ✅ **4. Ethical Value**

- "Right to exist" – Every species has value even if not directly useful to humans.
    

#### ✅ **5. Aesthetic Value**

- Beauty and recreation (e.g., ecotourism, nature photography).
    

#### ✅ **6. Option Value**

- Potential future uses (e.g., undiscovered medicines).
    

#### ✅ **7. Ecosystem Service Value**

- Pollination, oxygen production, climate regulation, soil fertility.
    

---

### 🔹 4.6 **Threats to Biodiversity**

1. **Habitat loss** – Deforestation, urbanization.
    
2. **Poaching and hunting** – Illegal killing for fur, horns, etc.
    
3. **Pollution** – Air, water, and soil pollution destroy habitats.
    
4. **Climate Change** – Global warming, glacier melting.
    
5. **Invasive species** – Non-native species that threaten local biodiversity (e.g., lantana, water hyacinth).
    

---

### 🔹 4.7 **Conservation of Biodiversity**

#### ✅ **1. In-Situ Conservation** – _Conserving in natural habitat_

- **National Parks** – No human activity allowed (e.g., Kaziranga).
    
- **Wildlife Sanctuaries** – Limited human activity allowed (e.g., Periyar).
    
- **Biosphere Reserves** – Large areas with core, buffer, and transition zones.
    
- **Sacred groves** – Forest patches protected by tribes and communities.
    

#### ✅ **2. Ex-Situ Conservation** – _Outside natural habitat_

- **Zoos** and **botanical gardens**
    
- **Gene banks** – Seed banks, cryopreservation
    
- **Captive breeding** and reintroduction
    

---

### 🔹 4.8 **Hotspots of Biodiversity**

- Regions with:
    
    - Very high species richness
        
    - High levels of endemism (species found nowhere else)
        
    - Highly threatened ecosystems
        
- **India’s 4 Hotspots**:
    
    - Western Ghats
        
    - Eastern Himalayas
        
    - Indo-Burma
        
    - Nicobar Islands (part of Sundaland)
        

---

### 🔹 4.9 **Endangered and Endemic Species**

#### ✅ Endangered Species

- Species at risk of extinction.
    
- Examples: Tiger, Asiatic Lion, Great Indian Bustard.
    

#### ✅ Endemic Species

- Species found only in a particular area.
    
- Examples: Lion-tailed macaque (Western Ghats), Nilgiri tahr.

### 🔚 **Conclusion**

Biodiversity is vital for ecosystem balance, survival, and sustainable development. Conservation through individual and government action is essential to protect the planet's biological wealth.
