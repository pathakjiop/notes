## 🌍 **Unit 1: Multidisciplinary Nature of Environmental Studies**

### 🔹 1.1 **Definition of Environment**

- **Environment**: The sum total of all surroundings of a living organism, including natural forces and other living things.
    
- It provides conditions for development and growth as well as of danger and damage.
    

### 🔹 1.2 **Components of the Environment**

1. **Natural Environment**
    
    - Includes **air, water, land, flora, fauna, soil**, etc.
        
    - Divided into:
        
        - **Biotic** (living things – plants, animals, microorganisms)
            
        - **Abiotic** (non-living things – air, water, soil, temperature)
            
2. **Human-Made (Anthropogenic) Environment**
    
    - Created by humans: cities, buildings, roads, technologies.
        
3. **Social and Cultural Environment**
    
    - Includes traditions, beliefs, customs, norms, ethics, etc.
