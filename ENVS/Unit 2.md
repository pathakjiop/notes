## ðŸŒ¿ **Unit 2: Natural Resources**

### ðŸ”¹ 2.1 **Introduction**

- **Natural resources** are materials obtained from nature that are used by humans for survival and development.
    
- Can be **renewable** (sunlight, wind, water) or **non-renewable** (coal, petroleum, minerals).
    
- Overexploitation leads to environmental degradation, resource depletion, and imbalance in ecosystems.

### ðŸ”¹ 2.2 **Types of Natural Resources**

#### âœ… 1. **Forest Resources**

- **Uses**: Timber, fuelwood, paper, medicinal plants, biodiversity.
    
- **Functions**: Regulate climate, prevent soil erosion, maintain water cycle.
    
- **Deforestation**:
    
    - Causes: Agriculture, urbanization, logging, mining.
        
    - Consequences: Loss of biodiversity, climate change, soil erosion, droughts.
        
- **Conservation methods**:
    
    - Afforestation and reforestation
        
    - Agroforestry
        
    - Controlled logging
        
    - Social forestry (community involvement)

#### âœ… 2. **Water Resources**

- **Importance**: Drinking, agriculture, industry, power generation.
    
- **Problems**:
    
    - Water scarcity
        
    - Groundwater depletion
        
    - Pollution (industrial, agricultural runoff)
        
    - Dams and conflicts (e.g., Narmada Dam issues)
        
- **Conservation strategies**:
    
    - Rainwater harvesting
        
    - Watershed management
        
    - Efficient irrigation methods (drip, sprinkler)
        
    - Reuse and recycling

#### âœ… 3. **Mineral Resources**

- **Types**: Metallic (iron, copper), Non-metallic (mica, limestone), Energy minerals (coal, petroleum).
    
- **Uses**: Construction, industries, energy production.
    
- **Problems**:
    
    - Non-renewable and exhaustible
        
    - Environmental damage (land degradation, water pollution)
        
    - Health hazards to miners
        
- **Conservation**:
    
    - Sustainable mining
        
    - Recycling and reuse
        
    - Alternative materials

#### âœ… 4. **Food Resources**

- **Sources**: Agriculture, fisheries, animal husbandry.
    
- **Problems**:
    
    - Overgrazing
        
    - Overfishing
        
    - Green Revolution side effects (soil salinity, pesticide poisoning)
        
    - Unequal distribution leading to hunger and malnutrition
        
- **Solutions**:
    
    - Sustainable agriculture (organic farming)
        
    - GM crops (with caution)
        
    - Aquaculture and fish conservation

#### âœ… 5. **Energy Resources**

- **Types**:
    
    - **Conventional**: Fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas)
        
    - **Non-conventional**: Solar, wind, tidal, geothermal, biogas
        
- **Issues with fossil fuels**:
    
    - Limited availability
        
    - Pollution and greenhouse gas emissions
        
- **Need for renewable energy**:
    
    - Clean and sustainable
        
    - Helps reduce dependence on fossil fuels
        
    - Examples: Solar panels, wind turbines, biogas plants

#### âœ… 6. **Land Resources**

- **Use**: Agriculture, housing, industry, forestry.
    
- **Problems**:
    
    - Land degradation
        
    - Soil erosion
        
    - Desertification
        
    - Urban sprawl
        
- **Conservation techniques**:
    
    - Contour plowing
        
    - Terrace farming
        
    - Crop rotation
        
    - Land-use planning

### ðŸ”¹ 2.3 **Equitable Use of Resources for Sustainable Lifestyle**

- **Equity**: Resources must be distributed fairly among all people and regions.
    
- **Sustainable development**:
    
    - Meeting present needs without compromising the future.
        
    - Includes environmental protection, social equity, and economic growth.
        
- **Individual responsibilities**:
    
    - Reduce, reuse, recycle
        
    - Energy and water conservation
        
    - Support eco-friendly products
