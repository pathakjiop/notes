## ðŸŒ± **Unit 3: Ecosystems**

### ðŸ”¹ 3.1 **What is an Ecosystem?**

- **Ecosystem**: A biological community of interacting organisms (biotic) and their physical environment (abiotic).
    
- **Examples**: Forest, desert, pond, ocean, grassland.
    
- Ecosystems can be **natural** (e.g., forest, river) or **artificial** (e.g., aquarium, garden).

### ðŸ”¹ 3.2 **Structure of an Ecosystem**

#### âœ… **1. Biotic Components** (Living organisms)

- **Producers** (Autotrophs): Green plants, algae (make food via photosynthesis).
    
- **Consumers**:
    
    - Primary (herbivores â€“ deer, cow)
        
    - Secondary (carnivores â€“ frog, fox)
        
    - Tertiary (top carnivores â€“ tiger, lion)
        
- **Decomposers** (Saprotrophs): Bacteria, fungi (break down dead matter)
    

#### âœ… **2. Abiotic Components** (Non-living)

- Sunlight, temperature, rainfall, soil, pH, minerals, air.

### ðŸ”¹ 3.3 **Function of an Ecosystem**

- **Energy Flow**:
    
    - Unidirectional flow from sun â†’ producers â†’ consumers.
        
    - Only **10% energy** is passed on to next trophic level (10% law).
        
- **Nutrient Cycling**:
    
    - Movement of nutrients like carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus between organisms and the environment.
        
- **Ecological Succession**:
    
    - Gradual change in ecosystem structure (e.g., pond â†’ marsh â†’ forest).
        
    - Two types:
        
        - **Primary**: Starts on bare land (lava, rocks).
            
        - **Secondary**: Re-establishment after disturbance (fire, flood).

### ðŸ”¹ 3.4 **Food Chain and Food Web**

#### âœ… **Food Chain**

- Linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass.
    
- Example:
    
    - Grass â†’ Grasshopper â†’ Frog â†’ Snake â†’ Hawk
        

#### âœ… **Types of Food Chains**

1. **Grazing Food Chain** â€“ Starts from producers.
    
2. **Detritus Food Chain** â€“ Starts from dead organic matter.
    

#### âœ… **Food Web**

- Interconnected food chains in an ecosystem.
    
- More realistic and stable than a single food chain.
    

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3.5 **Trophic Levels**

- The levels in a food chain:
    
    - **1st**: Producers
        
    - **2nd**: Primary consumers
        
    - **3rd**: Secondary consumers
        
    - **4th**: Tertiary consumers

### ðŸ”¹ 3.6 **Ecological Pyramids**

- Graphical representation of trophic levels.
    
- Types:
    
    1. **Pyramid of Number** â€“ Based on number of organisms.
        
    2. **Pyramid of Biomass** â€“ Based on total biomass.
        
    3. **Pyramid of Energy** â€“ Always upright.

### ðŸ”¹ 3.7 **Types of Ecosystems**

#### âœ… 1. **Forest Ecosystem**

- **Components**: Trees, shrubs, animals, soil, microorganisms.
    
- High biodiversity and productivity.
    
- Services: COâ‚‚ absorption, habitat, climate regulation.
    

#### âœ… 2. **Grassland Ecosystem**

- Dominated by grasses.
    
- Grazing animals (deer, bison).
    
- Threats: Overgrazing, conversion to farmland.
    

#### âœ… 3. **Desert Ecosystem**

- Hot or cold, low rainfall.
    
- Plants: Cactus, shrubs.
    
- Animals: Snakes, lizards, camels.
    
- Adaptations for water conservation.
    

#### âœ… 4. **Aquatic Ecosystem**

- Includes both freshwater and marine ecosystems.
    
    **A. Freshwater Ecosystems**
    
    - Rivers, lakes, ponds.
        
    - Organisms: Fish, frogs, aquatic plants.
        
    
    **B. Marine Ecosystems**
    
    - Oceans, seas, estuaries.
        
    - Organisms: Algae, plankton, fish, whales, corals.
        
    - Features: High salt content, tidal action, vast biodiversity.

### ðŸ”š **Conclusion**

Ecosystems are the foundation of ecological balance. Understanding energy flow, food chains, and biodiversity helps in conservation and sustainable management of natural systems.
