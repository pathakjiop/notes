**UNIT 4: CONTROL UNIT - DETAILED NOTES**

---

### 1. INTRODUCTION TO CONTROL UNIT

- The **Control Unit (CU)** is a crucial part of the CPU.
    
- It **directs the flow of data** between the CPU and other devices.
    
- It interprets instruction codes and generates timing and control signals.

### 2. TYPES OF CONTROL UNIT

#### a. Hardwired Control Unit

- Uses **fixed logic circuits**.
    
- Control signals are generated by **combinational logic**.
    
- **Fast** but **inflexible**.
    

**Block Diagram:**

- Inputs: Instruction register, clock
    
- Outputs: Control signals to datapath
    
- Logic gates and flip-flops used
    

**Advantages:**

- High speed
    
- Less hardware requirement
    

**Disadvantages:**

- Difficult to modify
    
- Complex for large instruction sets

#### b. Microprogrammed Control Unit

- Uses a **control memory** to store microinstructions.
    
- Each instruction is executed by a **sequence of micro-operations**.
    
- More **flexible** and **easy to update**.
    

**Components:**

- Control memory
    
- Control address register (CAR)
    
- Control data register (CDR)
    
- Sequencer to determine the next microinstruction
    

**Advantages:**

- Easy to modify/control
    
- Suitable for complex instructions
    

**Disadvantages:**

- Slower than hardwired control

### 3. COMPARISON BETWEEN HARDWIRED AND MICROPROGRAMMED CONTROL

|Feature|Hardwired Control|Microprogrammed Control|
|---|---|---|
|Speed|Faster|Slower|
|Flexibility|Less|More|
|Complexity|More (for CISC)|Less|
|Modification|Difficult|Easy|
|Cost|Low|High|

### 4. MICROINSTRUCTION FORMATS

- **Horizontal Microinstruction**: All control signals specified explicitly.
    
    - Longer but faster.
        
- **Vertical Microinstruction**: Encoded signals, shorter format.
    
    - Easier to decode but slower.
        

---

### 5. MICROPROGRAM SEQUENCING

#### a. Need for Sequencing

- To determine the address of the next microinstruction.
    
- Based on current instruction, flags, or control logic.
    

#### b. Methods of Sequencing

1. **Incrementing CAR**: For next sequential instruction.
    
2. **Branching**: For conditional/unconditional jumps.
    
3. **Mapping**: From opcode to microinstruction start.
    
4. **Subroutine**: Reusable microinstruction sequence.

### 6. MICROPROGRAMMED CONTROL UNIT DESIGN

#### a. Control Memory Organization

- Stores microinstructions.
    
- Each location = one microinstruction.
    
- Addressed by the **Control Address Register (CAR)**.
    

#### b. Control Word

- A binary encoded format that specifies the micro-operations.
    
- Controls the datapath components.
    

#### c. Sequencer Design

- Determines the next value of CAR.
    
- Can use multiplexers and logic circuits.

### 7. EXECUTION CYCLE OVERVIEW

#### a. Instruction Cycle Steps:

1. **Fetch**: Get instruction from memory.
    
2. **Decode**: Interpret the instruction.
    
3. **Execute**: Perform the operation.
    
4. **Store**: Write result back to memory/register.
    

#### b. Role of CU in Execution Cycle:

- Activates necessary datapath signals in each phase.
    
- Controls memory read/write and ALU operation.
    

---

### 8. DESIGN OF CONTROL LOGIC

- Control logic can be implemented using:
    
    - **PLA (Programmable Logic Array)**
        
    - **ROM (Read-Only Memory)** for microinstructions
        

---

### 9. EXAM PREPARATION TIPS

- Draw diagrams of both **Hardwired** and **Microprogrammed** CU.
    
- Memorize differences between the two types.
    
- Practice writing microinstruction formats.
    
- Understand how sequencing and CAR work.
    
- Be able to explain control word and its role in datapath control.
